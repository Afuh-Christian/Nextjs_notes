# Api routes 
    -Are special routes (pages) which do not return html code 
    -Accept incoming http request , GET , POST , PATCH ,DELETE etc  with json data attarched to them 
    -from here you can store data in a database and then retrun json data 


    -api routes allows us to build api endpoints as part of the next project .. 

    -both the back end and front end will be served by thesame server


# create api in pages

pages 
    api 


js will pick any files in the above directory and turn then into api routes .... 

# and js files that will act as path sengments in the url ..


pages 
    api 
        new-meetup 

# a request is made to api/new-meetup , it will trigger the function found in it ..... 

these functions contain req , res 

req 
 -method 
 -body 
 -headers 

res 
 -params 
 etc ..
